Micropython, esp8266 and ws2812b 16x16 matrix... What can go wrong?


.mpy files these are the files converted by the mpy-cross tool to bytecode \n
/// mpy-cross -march=<architecture> -X emit=bytecode <file> /// \n
for esp8266 architecture = xtensa, for esp32 = xtensawin \n 
used migrating to native device code using @micropython.native on esp8266 version \n
